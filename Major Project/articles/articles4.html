                <h1>Do I need protein shakes?</h1>
                <p>
                    With interest in protein shakes and powders growing more every year, questions around usage,
                    benefits, training supplementation, and how much is too much are more common than ever.
                    Keep reading to learn more about protein powders and muscle growth, and whether they’re a viable
                    option to help you reach your training goals.
                </p>

                <h5>What is a protein shake?</h5>
                <p>
                    You can buy readymade protein shakes or purchase a bag of powder to make your own at home. Protein
                    powder can be dissolved and mixed with milk, water, juice or certain types of food to enhance your
                    daily protein intake.

                    The benefits of protein powder drinks are that they are quick, easy, and are a great source of
                    protein for people who exercise regularly and find it hard to get 100% of their protein from food
                    alone.

                    Most people take a protein shake after the gym to avoid eating a full meal before bed. They’re also
                    a common supplementation for those of us with specific dietary requirements who struggle to meet
                    their daily protein intake from food alone.
                </p>

                <h5>Understanding the value of pure protein</h5>
                <p>
                    There are many different types of protein powder, so it's important you get the right one. Pure
                    proteins are exactly what they say they are.

                    They are proteins that are free of additives. Pure protein powders include:
                </p>

                <p>1. Whey protein powders </p>
                <p>2. Pea protein powders </p>
                <p>3. Hemp protein powders </p>
                <p>4. Soya powders </p>
                <p>5. Egg powders</p>

                <p>
                    These powders can be mixed with water, one of your five fruit or veg, or juice. You can even add
                    your protein powder to porridge. Doing this is a useful way for someone intolerant to the common
                    breakfast proteins of eggs and yoghurt to supplement their protein intake at the start of the day.
                </p>

                <h5>How much powder is right for me?</h5>
                <p>
                    How much powder to take and whether you should drink protein shakes everyday is a commonly asked
                    question.

                    Using the information above, you should now know how much protein you need to meet your goals.
                    Whilst there’s nothing wrong with having a shake or protein smoothie every day, you should aim to
                    get as much of your protein from your diet as possible. You can then supplement where necessary with
                    shakes, bars, and powders.

                    Bottled protein shakes typically contain between 20g and 30g of protein. Powders that you take
                    yourself differ because you can use as much or as little as you like, however a typical protein
                    powder scoop will provide roughly the same amount of protein per serving as a readymade shake.
                </p>

                <h5>Do I need protein powder if I work out?</h5>
                <p>
                    Absolutely not. Because of the close marketing link between the gym and protein supplements, powders
                    and supplements are often viewed as a necessary tool for working out.

                    This couldn’t be further from the case. Protein powder is a great way for people who train hard to
                    supplement their hard work in the gym. There are many other factors that influence muscle growth
                    which are far more important than your protein supplementation.

                    If you’re looking to build muscle, adopt a regimented weightlifting routine, ensure you’re eating a
                    healthy diet rich in macronutrients, and prioritise rest and recovery in between workouts.
                </p>

                <h5>How much protein do I need in a day?</h5>
                <p>
                    The amount of protein you need depends on a variety of factors like age, sex, activity level, and
                    your goals. As a general guideline, active individuals looking to maintain or build muscle should
                    aim for between 0.7 and 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight (or 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram
                    of body weight).

                    If weight loss is your focus, this number is slightly different. Those focusing on weight loss
                    should aim for the higher end of this range to help preserve muscle mass whilst losing fat.

                    These numbers are a rough guide and are no replacement for a tailored made plan by a dietician or
                    nutritionist. Before undertaking any change to your diet, always consult a healthcare professional
                    to assess what changes are best for you and your body.
                </p>
